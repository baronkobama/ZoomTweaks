# ZoomTweaks-PY-v2.2.1-ALPHA

Dependencies:
- Windows OS (win32api is used in the script which is not supported by other operating systems)
- Python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- PySimpleGUI (pip install PySimpleGUI) 
- schedule (pip install schedule)

Currently working on a rewrite of the project (its really messy right now)\
(To use script run setup.py on first run and main.py if any issues arise after setup)


Planned Additions:
- Script Toggle (disable script when unneeded such as during the summer)
- Mute/Unmute Zoom Toggle (disable zoom volume on join)
- Chat Notifications? (popup notifications in the bottom left of screen for every message)
- 2 Modes (Auto-join + bypass camera prompt / Require confirmation & no bypass)
- (MOBILE TERMINAL FOR SENDING MESSAGES BRO???)
- Specific day toggle (able to toggle what days to run on)
- Rework time system (time in which main.py launches from scheduler and when main.py pushes to scheduler)

Finished Additions:
- Debug logger (logger to send debugging info to a text file)
- Verbose Error/Exception Handling (add exception/error handling for all functions)

ETA:
- Verbose error/exception handling + debug logger = ~ Christmas 2020
- Complete Restructure/Rewrite = ~ Jan-Early Feb 2021
- Release to Beta = ~ Feb 2021
- 2 modes + specific day toggle + chat notifications (MAYBE) + script toggle = ~ Mar-Apr 2021
- Mute/unmute zoom toggle + mobile terminal = TBD
- ****All ETAs listed above are not guaranteed, only rough estimates***
